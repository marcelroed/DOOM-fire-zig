# DOOMFIRE
## Test your TTY's might!

The doom-fire algo can push upwards of 180k a frame - results may vary!  It is, to my surprise, a nice TTY stress test.

As a comparison, this is the younger sibling of a node variant ( https://github.com/const-void/DOOM-fire-node ).

# INSTALL
```
$ git clone https://github.com/const-void/DOOM-fire-zig/
$ cd DOOM-fire-zig
$ zig build run
...
```
Build Requirements:
* all platforms - libc
* all platforms - x64 (for now)
* windows - kernel32

Merge Request (MR) Validation:
* Each MR tested on MacOS Sequia 15.3 / M1 w/zig 0.13 on MacOS Kitty, VS Code, Alacritty.
* Many MR tested on Windows 10 / Intel, with Microsoft Terminal, CMD.EXE, PowerShell.
* Linux tests are c/o the wonderful community who help identify...and repair...cross platform issues!


# Results
Start your favorite terminal, maximize it, then launch DOOM-fire-zig! Test your terminal's might. 

| Terminal           | Linux  | MacOS        | Windows          |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Alacritty          | great? | great        | very poor (4pfs) |
| Apple Terminal.app | -      | poor (? fps) | -                |
| CMD.EXE            | -      | -            | poor (20fps)     |
| iterm.app          | -      | ok           | -                |
| kitty.app          | -      | great        | -                |
| Microsoft Terminal | -      | -            | great            |
| Powershell         | -      | -            | poor (20fps)     |
| VS Code            | great  | great        | poor (20fps)     |
| Warp               | great? | great        | -                |
| WezTerm            | ?      | ?            | ok               |

### Definitions
```
<=   5 avg fps = very poor
<=  24 avg fps = poor
   ... avg fps = ok
>= 100 avg fps = great
```

### Microsoft Note
It appears Windows terminal performance is a function of the underlying console; when a terminal is using the default Microsoft console, such as used by CMD.EXE, Windows fps appears to be gated.

### MacOS / Apple Note
The default MacOS / Apple terminal reports an avg 30-40 fps, however visually, it appears to be drop frames, resulting in a very choppy effect.
 
## Results are for fun
As our approach is unscientific, we only indicate avg fps for underpeformers, to set expectations; results will vary based on - os+platform, GPU, terminal size (function of font size, monitor resolution, zoom %, etc), specific terminal configuration, terminal version -- even zig itself is a factor. 

We don't test every terminal with each merge request; the majority come from the community. One report is enough! This is for fun, to encourage terminals to be great out-of-the-box, and us to learn - to explore what our terminals can do, and share configuration that gives fps a boost (at potential cost elsewhere...).

180kb a frame at 100+fps is...great!!! Amazing.
